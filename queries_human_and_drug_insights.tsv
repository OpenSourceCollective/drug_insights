How do the side effects of the antimalarial drug mefloquine compare with those of artemisinin-based combination therapies?	They both cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,headaches,skin reactions. However,artemisinin based combinations do not cause neuropsychiatric reactions unlike mefloquine.	Common side effects of mefloquine include dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, skin reactions, sleep disorders, vision disorders, and vomiting. Severe side effects can include neuropsychiatric symptoms, acute kidney injury, arrhythmias, and psychosis. Artemisinin-based combination therapies are generally well-tolerated but can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, with serious side effects including cinchonism and cardiac arrhythmias.

What are the considerations for antimalarial treatments in pregnant women?	The treatment of oral and intravenous dose of quinine can be given in pregnancy. It should be followed with 7 days of dose of clindamycin. Doxycyline should be avoided in pregnancy because it can cause teeth and skeletal malformation.

What are the considerations for drug interactions in pregnant women taking anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis?	Oral anticoagulants are teratogenic and should not be given in the first trimester of pregnancy.They cross the placenta and cause a risk of placenta and fetal haemorrhage especially during the last few weeks of pregnancy and at delivery.	"- Oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, should be avoided in the first trimester due to teratogenicity and in the last few weeks of pregnancy due to the risk of placental or fetal hemorrhage.
- Women at risk of pregnancy should be warned of these dangers and alternative anticoagulants should be considered.
- Stopping warfarin before the sixth week of gestation may largely avoid the risk of fetal abnormality.
